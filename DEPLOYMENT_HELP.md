# Alternative Setup - Move files to root directory for easier deployment

If you can't access the Pages section, let's move the website files to your root directory for simpler deployment.

## Quick Fix - Root Directory Deployment:

1. Copy these files from `docs/` folder to your main project folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css` 
   - `script.js`

2. Upload to GitHub repository root
3. In Settings → Pages, select "main branch" and "/ (root)"

## Alternative: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

If Pages section is not visible, create this file in your repository:

**File: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`**

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: './docs'
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

This will automatically deploy your docs folder to GitHub Pages.

## Verify Your Repository:
- ✅ Repository is PUBLIC
- ✅ Files are uploaded
- ✅ You're in repository Settings (not account settings)
- ✅ Look for "Pages" in left sidebar under "Code and automation" section
